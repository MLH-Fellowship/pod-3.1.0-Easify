## What it does
Easify is a smart chrome extension. This extension will help you smartly and drastically increase your personal productivity while surfing the internet while taking care of your health and well-being. It will act as your personal companion by keeping constant checks over your emotions, your posture and maintaining your productivity while browsing. When a user gets distracted it will politely remind the user that they are getting distracted. It suggests user remedies such as “take a break” or “have a cup of coffee” along with suggesting some music from their playlist or otherwise, based on the user's emotion. Users will also be given a choice to analyze his/her mood and number of distractions over time in order to retrospect their productivity and health. On the basis of screentime, it will also remind the user to take refreshment breaks to hydrate themselves.
